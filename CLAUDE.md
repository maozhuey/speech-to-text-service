# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Populate your project context:
- "Please read openspec/project.md and help me fill it out with details about my project, tech stack, and conventions"

Create your first change proposal:
- "I want to add [YOUR FEATURE HERE]. Please create an OpenSpec change proposal for this feature"

Learn the OpenSpec workflow:
- "Please explain the OpenSpec workflow from openspec/AGENTS.md and how I should work with you on this project"

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.
